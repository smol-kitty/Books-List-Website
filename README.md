Go to MongoDB website, log in to your account (create a new account if you don't have one), create a free database/cluster in a new project in your account and assign it a username & password (without '@').<br>
Change the <username> & <password> in /backend/config.js to your database username & password.<br>
Open your terminal and enter the following commands sequentially (without colons): 'cd backend', 'npm i node', 'npm run dev'.<br>
Open a new terminal window using '+' at the top of the terminal and enter the following commands sequentially (without colons): 'cd frontend', 'npm i node', 'npm run dev'.<br>
Once the commands are run in the terminal in frontend folder, a localhost link (https://localhost:xyz, xyz - port address) will appear in the terminal, which should be opened in the browser.<br>
